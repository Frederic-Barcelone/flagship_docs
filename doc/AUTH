A Word on Authentication

Currently, the trunk of Flagship uses an authentication scheme designed for
our use at RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute).  This is implemented using
CAS for authentication and LDAP to help figure out people's names.

If you're running CAS and LDAP, setup should be extremely straightfoward by
creating the appropriate initializer files in config/initializers.

If you're like the rest of the world who doesn't use CAS or LDAP, you'll 
want to implement the following functions somewhere:

current_user - Return the currently logged in user or nil

logged_in? - Return true/false if the user is logged in or not

admin_logged_in? - Return true/false if the user is an admin

There are two sample files available, should you want to remove
authenticates_rpi, and replace it with your own authentication
scheme.
