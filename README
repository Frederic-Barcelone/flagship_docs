4. rake sunspot:solr:start
5. Enjoy.


Notes:
Delayed Job (https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job/) is used to extract the text from
documents asynchronously.  You'll want to have it running if you want your document content to be
indexed.  For more information how to start it, check out their readme.

Sunspot does the actual indexing and searching using Solr.  If you are running this in production
you might want to install and configure a more potent solr installation, but the default works
great for development.  To refresh the index manually use: `rake sunspot:reindex`.
